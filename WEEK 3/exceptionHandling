Managing Exceptions Effectively
In the world of programming, errors and unexpected situations are certain. Python, a popular and versatile programming language, equips developers with a powerful toolset to manage these unforeseen scenarios through exceptions and error handling.
What are exceptions?
Exceptions are alerts when something unexpected happens while running a program. It could be a mistake in the code or a situation that was not planned for. Python can raise these alerts automatically, but we can also trigger them on purpose using the raise command. The cool part is that we can prevent our program from crashing by handling exceptions.

Errors vs. Exceptions
Hold on, what is the difference between errors and exceptions? Well, errors are usually big problems that come from the computer or the system. They often make the program stop working completely. On the other hand, exceptions are more like issues we can control. They happen because of something we did in our code and can usually be fixed, so the program keeps going.

Here is the difference between Errors and exceptions:-

classes, such as “ArithmeticError,” “IOError,”
“ValueError,” etc., based on their nature.
Common Exceptions in Python
Here are a few examples of exceptions we often run into and can handle using this tool:

ZeroDivisionError: This error arises when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics, causing an arithmetic error. For instance:
For example:
1
2
3
result = 10 / 0
print(result)
# Raises ZeroDivisionError
Copied!
ValueError: This error occurs when an inappropriate value is used within the code. An example of this is when trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer:
For example:
1
2
num = int("abc")
# Raises ValueError
Copied!
FileNotFoundError: This exception is encountered when an attempt is made to access a file that does not exist.
For example:
1
2
with open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()   # Raises FileNotFoundError
Copied!
IndexError: An IndexError occurs when an index is used to access an element in a list that is outside the valid index range.
For example:
1
2
3
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
value = my_list[1]  # No IndexError, within range
missing = my_list[5]  # Raises IndexError
Copied!
KeyError: The KeyError arises when an attempt is made to access a non-existent key in a dictionary.
For example:
1
2
3
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
value = my_dict.get("city")  # No KeyError, using .get() method
missing = my_dict["city"]  # Raises KeyError
Copied!
TypeError: The TypeError occurs when an object is used in an incompatible manner. An example includes trying to concatenate a string and an integer:
For example:
1
2
result = "hello" + 5
# Raises TypeError
Copied!
AttributeError: An AttributeError occurs when an attribute or method is accessed on an object that doesn't possess that specific attribute or method. For instance:
For example:
1
2
3
text = "example"
length = len(text)  # No AttributeError, correct method usage
missing = text.some_method()  # Raises AttributeError
Copied!
ImportError: This error is encountered when an attempt is made to import a module that is unavailable. For example: import non_existent_module
Note: Please remember, the exceptions you will encounter are not limited to just these. There are many more in Python. However, there is no need to worry. By using the technique provided below and following the correct syntax, you will be able to handle any exceptions that come your way.

Handling Exceptions:
Python has a handy tool called try and except that helps us manage exceptions.

Try and Except : You can use the try and except blocks to prevent your program from crashing due to exceptions.

Here's how they work:

The code that may result in an exception is contained in the try block.
If an exception occurs, the code directly jumps to except block.
In the except block, you can define how to handle the exception gracefully, like displaying an error message or taking alternative actions.
After the except block, the program continues executing the remaining code.
Example: Attempting to divide by zero
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
# using Try- except
try:
    # Attempting to divide 10 by 0
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handling the ZeroDivisionError and printing an error message
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
# This line will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred
print("outside of try and except block")
Copied!
Next Step
As we finish up this reading, you are ready to move on to the next part where you will practice handling errors. For better learning, try out different types of data in the lab. This way, you will encounter various errors and learn how to deal with them effectively. This knowledge will help you write stronger and more reliable code in the future.
